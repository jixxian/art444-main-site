            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>Kaiāulu is a cultural app designed for any user that is of Pacific Islander descent or just interested about Pacific Islander culture. Discover and Polynesian Dance are two key features of this app which gives the user the opportunity to share/view community posts, Pacific Islander dances made by the community, upcoming Pacific Islander events, and learn the basics of the culture's dance. The name Kaiāulu means “community” in Hawaiian, which is a value that this app aims to encourage.</p>

            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>For this project, I was tasked with designing a booklet centered around a passion of our choice. Kaiāulu is a guide to Pacific Islander dance groups in San Diego. This book is targeted towards those of Pacific Islander descent or those who are just interested in the culture! The booklet highlights specific Pacific Islander dance groups of various islands while incorporating a cohesive design system.</p>

            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>For this project I was tasked with designing a poster based on a song. The song that I chose to base my design on was "Decode" by Sabrina Carpenter. The song can be interpreted in different ways but for me, it is about the artist's inability to accept situations that are out of her control. The song talks about how the artist overthinks, overanalyzes, and keeps thinking about a certain person and what they do and letting it take over her mind. I expressed the concept of my design through fragmentation and deconstruction to touch on the negative emotions and convey a sense of confusion and busyness.</p>

            <p>For this project I was tasked with re-designing an already existing website for the non-profit organization: Grace Center located in Corvallis, Oregon. Their mission is to provide day services that optimize the cognitive and physical abilities of seniors and adults with disabilities so they can remain as independent as possible and in their homes. The main message that I wish the website to convey is that this organization is friendly, welcoming, and that the organization has a people-centered philosophy.</p>

            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this study was to create an abstract graphic mark derived from an object or word. The word that my project is based around is “crochet.” The key words that were being utilized in this logo creation were: looping, pattern, braid, and needles. The dashed lines represent the looping of yarn and the hooks represent the crochet needle hooks. After finalizing the logo, I translated them into practical applications including a stationery set, packaging and digital mockups.</p>

            <p>I was tasked to create a new t-shirt design for Maui High School's Show Choir. This t-shirt design features the text "Maui High Saber Sounds Show Choir". The logo that I created, which can be seen behind the text, visually represents the letter 'S', which stands for 'Saber Sounds'. The 'S' is created by using 5 lines and 4 spaces which represents a 'staff', which is a measurement for pitch in choir.</p>

        <h3 class="dark">WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE CLASS YOU TOOK AT SDSU?</h3>
       <p class="dark">My favorite class I took at SDSU is Self Defense for Women. In this class we learn the different ways to defend ourselves in the different situations we may find ourselves in. Learning all of the different techniques and practicing it with your classmates was so much fun, especially since the environment was so welcoming and empowering. I would say that my favorite technique that I learned was a hip throw.</p>

        <p class="dark">The work that I'm most proud of producing at SDSU is my "Kaiāulu" project from Typography II. Even though this project was extremely stressful and brought a lot of challenges with print vs online, I learned so much about the different programs I was using and overcame those challenges. This project pushed me and helped me grow as a designer.</p>
